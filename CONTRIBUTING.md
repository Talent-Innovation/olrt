# Contributing to OLRT

We welcome contributions from the community!  
This document explains how to propose changes, report issues, and follow project guidelines.

## How to contribute
- **Report issues**: use GitHub Issues. Please assign the correct labels (e.g. `etl`, `search`, `ui`, `docs`, `analysis`, `examples`, `setup`).
- **Propose changes**: create a Pull Request (PR) linked to an open Issue or Milestone.
- **Discussions**: for broader ideas, use GitHub Discussions or comments in Issues.

## Coding & documentation style
- Code should be modular, readable, and documented with inline comments.
- Follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python code.
- Markdown (`.md`) is used for all documentation in `/docs` and folder-level READMEs.

## Governance
- Issues are grouped under Milestones (see project roadmap).
- Each Issue should define a deliverable (document, feature, dataset).
- Labels are used to track work streams:  
  `etl`, `search`, `ui`, `docs`, `analysis`, `setup`, `examples`.

## Pull requests
- Each PR must reference the Issue it resolves.
- At least one review (by another contributor) is recommended before merging.
- Keep PRs focused: one logical change per PR.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your code/documentation will be released under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE).
