# OLRT – ETL pipeline

This folder will contain the code and scripts for data import and cleaning.

Planned features:
- Import from PDFs, DOCX, XML, scanned documents
- Text cleaning and normalization
- OCR support for image-based documents
- Legal-specific chunking (paragraphs, articles)
- Document versioning

ℹ️ ETL is the “data preparation layer” that makes documents searchable.
