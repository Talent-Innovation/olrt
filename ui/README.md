# OLRT – User Interface

This folder will contain the web-based user interface.

Planned features:
- Search bar with filters (document type, date, topic)
- Results with citations and links to original documents
- Conversational mode (ask in natural language)
- Responsive design (desktop + mobile)
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 compliance)

ℹ️ UI is the “face” of OLRT that makes the tool easy to use for staff.
